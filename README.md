\# Twitch Stream Monitor 🎥📊



This project is a real-time data pipeline for monitoring Twitch streamers, leveraging the Twitch API and \*\*Databricks\*\* for data engineering and analytics. The pipeline collects, processes, and analyzes streamer profile and stream session data in a structured medallion architecture (bronze → silver → gold), enabling performance tracking and trend reporting.
